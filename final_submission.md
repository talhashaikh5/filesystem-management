# File Management System

## Project and Developer Details

Project Name: File Management System

Developer: OpenAI

## Sprints and Tasks

The project is divided into multiple sprints to ensure timely completion. The following sprints and tasks have been achieved:

Sprint 1:
- Design and implement the welcome screen
- Display options for the user to select from: view files in ascending order, add a file, delete a file, search for a file, navigate back to the main context, and close the application

Sprint 2:
- Implement the file operations: add, delete, and search
- Return appropriate messages for successful or unsuccessful operations
- Implement linear search or binary search algorithms

Sprint 3:
- Optimize the source code using exception handling, data structures, and sorting algorithms
- Implement Git and GitHub for source code management
- Document the flow of the application using a flow chart

## Algorithms and Flow Chart

The application implements various algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, linear search, and binary search. The flow of the application is documented in a flow chart.

## Core Concepts

The following core concepts have been used in the project:
- Exception handling
- Data structures (arrays, lists, or sets)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort)
- Linear search or binary search algorithms
- Git and GitHub

## GitHub Repository

The source code for the File Management System is available on GitHub at [insert repository link].

## Conclusion

The File Management System is a menu-driven command line interface application that allows users to perform different file operations such as retrieving files in ascending order, adding a file, deleting a file, searching for a file, navigating back to the main context, and closing the application. The implementation of various algorithms and concepts results in optimized and efficient source code. The use of Git and GitHub allows for easy tracking and management of the source code.

The unique selling points of the application include:
- User-friendly interface
- Implementation of various algorithms for optimized and efficient performance
- Integration with Git and GitHub for source code management
- Support for multiple file operations

The application can be further enhanced by adding additional file operations and improving the user interface.
