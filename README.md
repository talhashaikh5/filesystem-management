# File Management System

This project is a menu-driven command line interface application that allows users to perform different file operations such as retrieving files in ascending order, adding a file, deleting a file, searching for a file, navigating back to the main context, and closing the application. 

## Features

- Display the welcome screen that includes application name and developer details
- Display options for the user to select from:
  - Option to view the current files in ascending order
  - Option to add, delete, or search for a file
  - Option to navigate back to the main context
  - Option to close the application
- Add a file to the existing directory list
- Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list
- Search for a user specified file from the main directory
- Return appropriate messages for successful or unsuccessful operations

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Exception handling
- Data structures (arrays, lists, or sets)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, or insertion sort)
- Linear search or binary search algorithms
- Git and GitHub

## Flow Chart

The flow of the application is documented in a flow chart. This includes the steps involved in the process and the various options available to the user.

## Sprint Plan

The project is divided into multiple sprints to ensure that it is completed in a timely manner. Each sprint has a specific set of tasks and goals that need to be accomplished. 

## How to Run the Application

The application can be run using Eclipse. Simply import the project and run it as a Java application.

## Conclusion
